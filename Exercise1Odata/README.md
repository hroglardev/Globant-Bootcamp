## Overview

The **Northwind OData API** is a demo service that provides access to a sample database containing data about products, customers, orders, and employees. Using OData, you can query this data with advanced filtering, sorting, and expansion features.

    <li>Get all employees who report to manager nÂ° 2</li>
    <li>Get all products that are in stock</li>

## How to test

</div>

## Parameters used


<ul>
  <li><b>$filter:</b> To filter the results by a criterion.</li>
  <li><b>$select:</b> To only select the properties of the base response that you would need to use.</li>
  <li><b>$top:</b> To limit the response to only the first 5 results.</li>
  <li><b>$orderby:</b> To sort the response by a criterion. At the moment the response returns a string therefore it is not working correctly. In a real world environment the selected criterion would need to be parsed to a number.</li>
  <li><b>$expand:</b> To add to the base result, the related entities from another collection that match the base response. In this example we get the Orders that correspond to a Client's ID as a Client may have multiple Orders.</li>
  <li><b>$format:</b> To format the response. This is optional. Should you want to keep the base format in XML, remove the parameter at the end of the query.</li>
</ul>
